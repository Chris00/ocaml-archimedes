(** Routines to draw basic axes systems in a 2-dimensional space. One can
    either draw axes separately using add_(x|y)_axis or use a full default
    axes system with box or cross. *)

(** The axis can be padded using an offset. It is used to control
    where to place the axis (according to the other axis) *)
type offset =
| Relative of float
(** A relative offset is given in the Data coordinate system. So
    you can ensure that the axis is drawn at the other axis'
    origin (offset: Relative 0.) *)
| Absolute of float
(** An absolute offset is given in the Graph coordinate system and
    should have a value between 0 and 1. Using this kind of
    offset, one can ensure to always get the same rendering *)

val x : ?grid:bool ->
  ?major:(string * float) -> ?minor:(string * float) ->
  ?start:Arrows.style -> ?stop:Arrows.style ->
  ?tics:Tics.t -> ?offset:offset -> Viewport.t -> unit
(** [x vp] adds an x-axis to the viewport [vp].

    @param major is a couple [(mark, size)] drawn at each major tic
    position.

    @param start the arrow ending style on the left (x0) (see the
    Arrows module)

    @param stop the arrow ending style on the right (xend) (see the
    Arrows module)

    @param tics the "tics policy" for this axis (see the Tics module)

    @param offset where to place the axis (y-coordinate) *)

  ?major:(string * float) -> ?minor:(string * float) ->
  ?start:Arrows.style -> ?stop:Arrows.style ->
  ?tics:Tics.t -> ?offset:offset -> Viewport.t -> unit
(** [y vp] adds an y-axis to the viewport [vp].

    @param start the arrow ending style on the bottom (y0) (see the
    Arrows module)

    @param stop the arrow ending style on the top (yend) (see the
    Arrows module)

    @param tics the "tics policy" for this axis (see the Tics module)

    @param offset where to place the axis (x-coordinate) *)

val box : ?grid:bool -> ?tics:Tics.t -> ?tics_alt:Tics.t -> Viewport.t -> unit
(** [box vp] A default system of axes consisting of four axes, one on
    each border of the viewport [vp], resulting in a box surrounding
    the viewport.

    @param tics the "tics policy" for the left and bottom axes (see
    the Tics module for more information over tics policies)

    @param tics_alt the "tics policy" for the right and top axes (see
    the Tics module for more information over tics policies) *)

val cross : ?tics:Tics.t -> Viewport.t -> unit
(** [cross vp] A default axes system consisting of two axes, centered
    on the origin ((0, 0) in Data coordinates).

    @param tics the "tics policy" of the axes (see the Tics module for
    more information over tics policies) *)
