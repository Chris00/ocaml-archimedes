(** When working in the toplevel, it is convenient to have a
    simplified interface so one can plot without having to declare any
    handle.  The usual Archimedes functions will remain available in
    case several concurrent plots are needed. *)

(* One must pass the usual Backend registration mechanism of Backend
   in the toplevel because, for example, loading graphics in this way
   raises: Assert_failure ("bytecomp/dll.ml", 109, 4).

   We use the toplevel mechanism to load the modules. *)
