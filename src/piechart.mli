                 keyscheme should then be used. *)
| CustomColors of (string * Color.t) list
(** A color scheme associating a custom color to each data. *)
| ValueDependant of (float -> Color.t)
(** Sometimes it is desirable to use color to express something on
    the piechart depending on the data values, this color scheme
    permits it. *)
| LevelValueDependant of (int -> int -> float -> Color.t -> float -> Color.t)
  (** For multi-levels pie charts, the color may depend of the
      level, the position (in the parent children's list), the
      parent data value/color and the actual value of the data to
      draw.  The level 0 is the first level with at least two
      elements. *)

type keyplacement =
| Rectangle (** A rectangle containing the color followed by the label
                of each data *)
| OverPie   (** The labels are drawn directly over the data *)
| Outer     (** The labels are drawn around the pie, next to the data they
                point out *)

type keylabels =
| Key          (** Just the name of the data *)
| WithValues   (** The name followed by the value between parentheses *)
| WithProcents (** The name followed by the procent among all data between
                   parentheses *)
| CustomLabels of (string -> float -> float -> string)
(** A custom label made of the name, the value and the percentage. *)

    @param yend these parameters delimits the area of the pie chart
    over the viewport. They are given in Graph coordinates (i.e. from

(** [multilevel vp data] draws a multilevel pie chart on [vp]. The
    default options are tuned for a multilevel pie chart

    @param style default is flat (better visualisation because there
    is usualy lots of data)

    @param colorscheme default is LevelValueDependant, colors of the
    first level to contain more than one data (= level 0) are chosen
    in the "Default" way, children colors are derived from their
    parent color and their value. Inner levels (those who contains
    only one data) are filled with blank

    @param keyplacement default is OverPie, this is usually the better
    way to visualize data over a multilevel pie chart

    @param keylabels default is Key, because the color scheme gives an
    idea of the values, it is preferable to save space by hiding the
    values / percentages of the data

    @param x0 the x-coordinate of the center (default: [0.]).

    @param y0 the y-coordinate of the center (default: [0.]).

    simple pie charts *)
