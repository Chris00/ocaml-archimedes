type t

val make: unit -> t
(** [make ()] creates a new empty path *)

val copy: t -> t
(** [copy p] copies a path *)

val make_at: float -> float -> t
(** [make x y] creates a new empty path and moves it to ([x], [y]) *)

val clear: t -> unit
(** [clear p] clears the path (removes all operations) *)

val extents: t -> Matrix.rectangle
(** [extents p] returns a copy of the path's extents *)

val move_to: t -> x:float -> y:float -> unit
(** [move_to p x y] moves the path's current point to ([x], [y]) *)

val line_to: t -> x:float -> y:float -> unit
(** [line_to p x y] draws a line from the path's current point to ([x],
    [y]) and sets the current point to ([x], [y]) *)

val rel_move_to: ?rot:float -> t -> x:float -> y:float -> unit
(** [rel_move_to p x y] shifts the path's current point of [x]
    horizontally and [y] vertically]

    @param rot (default: 0.) to consider a rotation of [rot] radians *)

val rel_line_to: ?rot:float -> t -> x:float -> y:float -> unit
(** [rel_line_to p x y] shifts the path's current point of [x]
    horizontally and [y] vertically and draws a line between the current
    and the new point

    @param rot (default: 0.) to consider a rotation of [rot] radians *)

val rectangle: t -> x:float -> y:float -> w:float -> h:float -> unit
(** [rectangle p x y w h] draws a rectangle specified by ([x], [y], [w],
    [h]) but does not move the path's current point *)

val curve_to: t -> x1:float -> y1:float -> x2:float -> y2:float ->
  x3:float -> y3:float -> unit
(** [curve_to p x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3] draws a cubic Bezier curve using the
    path's current point as first point (x0, y0) if it is set, else
    ([x1, y1]). Sets the path's current point to ([x3], [y3]) *)

val arc: t -> r:float -> a1:float -> a2:float -> unit
(** [arc p r a1 a2] draws an arc starting at the path's current
    point. The starting angle is [a1], the radius [r] and the arc is
    drawn clockwise to the angle [a2]. The angles are given in
    radians *)

val close: t -> unit
(** [close p] Closes the path. It is usually not required to close a
    path, this is useful only to ensure the path won't be extended. *)

val stroke_on_backend: ?limits:float * float * float * float ->
  t -> Backend.t -> unit
(** [stroke_on_backend p bk] strokes the path [p] on the backend
    [bk]. It will not clear the path [p] but will clear the path of
    [bk].

    @param limits a quartet of float indicating where to clip the
    path. Default: the unit rectangle. One can use (-infinity,
    -infinity, infinity, infinity) for no clip. *)

val fill_on_backend: ?limits:float * float * float * float ->
  t -> Backend.t -> unit
(** [fill_on_backend p bk] fills in the path [p] on the backend
    [bk]. It will not clear the path [p] but will clear the path of
    [bk].

    @param limits a quartet of float indicating where to clip the
    path. Default: the unit rectangle. One can use (neg_infinity,
    neg_infinity, infinity, infinity) for no clip. *)

val current_point: t -> float * float
(** [current_point p] returns the current point of the path *)

val transform: t -> (float * float -> float * float) -> t
(** [transform p f] returns a new path that is the path [p] transformed by
    function [f]. It only modifies end points of paths primitives and
    extents are leaved the same. *)

val print_path: t -> unit
(** [print_path p] Debug function (TODO hide it) *)

val add: t -> t -> unit
(** [add p to_add] Adds the path [to_add] to the end of [p] *)
