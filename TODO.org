#+STARTUP: showall

* Before 1.0

resizing

plot functions

implement missing functions in viewport.ml

transparency support

Can't catch a Cairo.Error.

Optimize behavior of empty marks.

function labels (tags)

draw axes when plotting a function with Plot.fx

Add clipping.

The Sizes module is not used anymore, in fact we consider that sizes are
absolute or relative to the dimensions of the viewport it belongs to. We don't
have any relativity of sizes from one viewport to another. Discuss if the
feature is really wanted.

Support for reversing the orientation of axes
(flipping the coordinates system won't do).

Arrows should be implemented in backends (since TikZ has its own implementation)

Add support of multi-line custom tics labels.

Add title function in viewports

Add support for "auto-ratio" syncing (don't require to specify a fixed ratio to
share).


* Far fetched

- advi => read TeX font metrics => correct text extents
