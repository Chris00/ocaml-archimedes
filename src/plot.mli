    fact that the x-values of iter are 0, 1, 2, etc. or 1, 2, 3,
    etc. or 42, 43, 44, etc. or ...

    @param fill fill the region between the iterator and its base ?
    (default: false)

    @param fillcolor which color to use for the fill

    @param pathstyle which pathstyle to use (see pathstyle type)

    @param base the base iterator is the other delimiter of the region
    to fill. Default: the zero iterator (giving (0, 0), (1, 0), (2,
    0), etc.) *)

    that the first iterator is plotted then used as the base for the
    second iterator, which is plotted and the sum of the two first
    iterators are used as the base for the third iterator,
    etc. Usually, the pathstyle used for a stack is Boxes, but one can
    use another pathstyle if he wants

    @param colors the colors to use for the iterators. If there are
    more iterators than colors available, a round-robin strategy is
    used to attribute colors

    @param fillcolors same as colors, but for filling colors

    default is [Boxes 0.5]) *)
