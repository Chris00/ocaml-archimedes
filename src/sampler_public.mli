    mainly based on an article from Graphics Gems vol. 5, page 173:
    Adaptive Sampling of Parametric Curves. *)

module type T = sig
  type strategy = float -> float -> float
    (** A strategy is a function [f t1 t2] that returns an internal point
        tm between t1 and t2 which will be used to decide if we need to
        increment precision or not. *)

  type criterion = float -> float -> float -> float -> float -> float -> bool
    (** A criterion is a function [f x1 y1 xm ym x2 y2] which returns true
        if we need to increment precision. *)

  val strategy_midpoint : strategy
    (** The default strategy: choose the middle point *)

  val strategy_random : strategy
    (** A strategy that avoids aliasing sampling, but not efficient:
        chooses randomly a point between t1 and t2 *)

  val strategy_center_random : strategy
    (** A more efficient strategy that avoids aliasing sampling: chooses
        randomly a points between t1 and t2 in its 10% center interval *)

  val criterion_none : criterion
    (** A criterion that tells to never increment precision *)

  val criterion_angle : ?threshold:float -> criterion
    (** A criterion that tells to increment precision only if the angle
        xMy is leather than threshold

        @param threshold the minimal angle under which no more precision
        is needed
    *)

  val criterion_angle_log : bool -> bool -> ?threshold:float -> criterion
    (** Same criterion as criterion_angle, but one can tell that the x/y
        axis is logarithmic, and increment precision in a more wise way *)

    ?strategy:strategy -> ?criterion:criterion ->

    (** [create f t1 t2] samples the parametric function f from t1 to t2,
        returning a list of the points in the sample.

        @param tlog do we need to step in a logarithmic way ?

        @param min_step don't increment precision more than this threshold

        @param nsamples base number of samples wanted (cut the space
        between t1 and t2 in nsamples fragments of equivalent size,
        depending on tlog)

        @param strategy a customized strategy, which can be chosen among
        those in this module

        @param criterion a customized criterion, which can be chosen among
        those in this module
